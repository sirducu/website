# website
This is the project I am currently still working on..
website is radu.ovh
It is hosted on a VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER and uses NGINX as a web server.
The website contains the following :
1) Facebook Reel and Video downloader, which uses yt_dlp library for downloading the videos.
2) Youtube Video and Audio downloader, which uses yt_dlp library for downloading the videos.
3) TikTok Downloader without watermark, which uses an API from lovetik.com, although i could use the yt_dlp library...
4) URL Shortener uses random and string to randomize the letters and numbers, psycopg2 for comunicating with the database which is in postgresql,
5) URL Shortener API, which uses the GET method with "URL=?" as argument, since I haven't been able to figure out why POST method does not work, but currently working on it.
There is also a Youtube Downloader API linked to https://radu[dot]ovh/ytdl which uses the same GET method with "URL=?" as argument.

Hope you guys like my project.. 
I will be adding more things in the future ..
