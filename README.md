# website
This is the project I am currently still working on..<br>
website is radu.ovh<br>
It is hosted on a VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVER and uses NGINX as a web server.<br>
The website contains the following :<br>
1) Facebook Reel and Video downloader, which uses yt_dlp library for downloading the videos.<br>
2) Youtube Video and Audio downloader, which uses yt_dlp library for downloading the videos.<br>
3) TikTok Downloader without watermark, which uses an API from lovetik.com, although i could use the yt_dlp library...<br>
4) URL Shortener uses random and string to randomize the letters and numbers, psycopg2 for comunicating with the database which is in postgresql,<br>
5) URL Shortener API, which uses the GET method with "URL=?" as argument, since I haven't been able to figure out why POST method does not work, but currently working on it.<br>
There is also a Youtube Downloader API linked to https://radu[dot]ovh/ytdl which uses the same GET method with "URL=?" as argument.<br>

Hope you guys like my project..<br>
I will be adding more things in the future ..<br>
